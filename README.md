Simple Application of Tranfer Learning along with lots of Data Augmentation ensures the model doesn't overfit on the dataset. Our model gives a staggering 99.4% validation accuracy!

## Note 
The competition actually involved using their desktop/cloud software which means that we couldn't exactly recreate this model there with the data augmentation. Thus, we are unable to post the test results for this model.
